🧑‍🤝‍🧑 D-FuseSmileNet (Spontaneous Smile Recognition)

> Built a transformer-based framework that fuses handcrafted physiological cues (D-Markers of facial muscles) with deep learned features for smile authenticity detection.

> Proposed a novel Hadamard multiplicative fusion method after benchmarking 15 fusion strategies.

> Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy across 4 benchmark datasets (MMI 99.7%, SPOS 98.5%, BBC 100%).

> Improved interpretability and reduced complexity compared to prior multi-task learning approaches.

> Applications: human-computer interaction, social robotics, healthcare diagnostics.
